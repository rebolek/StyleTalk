# StyleTalk

StyleTalk is a compact reworking of [CSS](http://w3.org/css "Cascading Style Sheets") in Rebol notation. It's designed to be more light-weight, expressive and deliberate.

# The Format

StyleTalk is just plain text containing: a few commands to include some core features, some selectors and some properties to apply to selected HTML/XML elements. Values only need be separated by white space and there's no requirement to hold to any particular space/newline/indent patterns. Squeeze everything on one line, or place each value on a separate line.

## css/reset

A short command to include [Eric Meyer's CSS Reset](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) style sheet, occasionally useful in circumventing differences between browsers.

## google fonts

A literate way to include [Google Web Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts/) into the style sheet. The format is simply Font Name (quoted) with accompanying styles with Hash (#) prefix:

```Rebol
google fonts
	"Open Sans" #regular #semibold #italic #italicsemibold
	"PT Sans" #400 #700 #400italic #700italic
	"PT Serif" #400 #700 #400italic #700italic
```

Although a URL obtained from Google can be used in place.

## Selectors

Currently there are four supported selector elements and three methods of establishing their relationship.

| Type | Example | Description
|----|----|----
| **Tags** | `<p> <h1> <div>` | Tags pertain to the generic elements of HTML.
| **IDs** | `#ticker #messagebox` | IDs apply to the specific element containing the matching ID.
| **Classes** | `.header .footer .attention` | Classes relate to elements with given classes.
| **Pseudo-Elements** | `:before :after :hover` | Pseudo elements are an adjunct to other elements that apply when those elements are in the given position/state.

Combinations of elements can be used as follows:

```Rebol
<b> <strong> #alertbox .attention
```

Rules will apply to all of the above elements.

```Rebol
<b> in .jumbotron
```

Rules will apply to all `<b>` elements contained within elements of class `jumbotron`.

```Rebol
<div> with .jumbotron
```

Rules will apply to all `div` elements with class `jumbotron`.

```Rebol
<p> <q> with .attention
```

Rules will apply to all `<p>` and `<q>` elements with class `attention`.

```Rebol
<pre> <code> with .rebol in #main
```

Rules will apply to all `<pre>` and `<code>` elements with class `rebol` contained within the element with the id `main`

Using `and` can separate rule combinations:

```Rebol
<pre> with .rebol and <code> with .red
```

Rules will apply to all `<pre>` elements with class `rebol` **and** `<code>` elements with class `red`.

Any rules used before the first selector will apply to the `<body>` element.

## Values

Values are an important component of each rule.

| Value | Sample
|----|----
| Zero | `0`
| Number | `1` or `-0.5`
| Ems | `em 1` (or Zero)
| Pixels | `1` or `px 1` (or Zero)
| Degrees | `deg 45` (or Zero)
| Scalars | `* 1.5` (or Zero)
| Percent | `pct 90` (or Zero)
| Color | `102.153.204` or `204.204.153.51` or any valid CSS named color, e.g. `black`, `red`
| Time | `0:0:1`
| Pair | `900x510`
| File | `%/a/relative/location`
| Url | `http://some.distant/location`
| Position | </code>[top &#124; bottom &#124; right &#124; left]</code>
| Edge | <code>[[top &#124; bottom] [right &#124; left] &#124; top &#124; bottom &#124; right &#124; left]</code>
| Length | Ems, Pixels or Percent
| Angle | Degrees
