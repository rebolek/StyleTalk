=== Compact Style Sheets in Rebol

	Author: Christopher Ross-Gill
	Date: 23-June-2013

CSSR (Compact Style Sheets in Rebol) is a compact reworking of [CSS](http://w3.org/css "Cascading Style Sheets") in Rebol notation. It's designed to be more light-weight, expressive and deliberate.

=== The Format

CSSR is just plain text containing: a few commands to include some core features, some selectors and some properties to apply to selected HTML/XML elements. Values only need be separated by white space and there's no requirement to hold to any particular space/newline/indent patterns. Squeeze everything on one line, or place each value on a separate line.

--- css/reset

A short command to include [Eric Meyer's CSS Reset](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) style sheet, occasionally useful in circumventing differences between browsers.

--- google fonts

A literate way to include [Google Web Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts/) into the style sheet. The format is simply Font Name (quoted) with accompanying styles with Hash (#) prefix:

	google fonts
		"Open Sans" #regular #semibold #italic #italicsemibold
		"PT Sans" #400 #700 #400italic #700italic
		"PT Serif" #400 #700 #400italic #700italic

Although a URL obtained from Google can be used in place.

--- Selectors

Currently there are four supported selector elements and three methods of establishing their relationship.

\table condensed

Type
Example
Description

=b Tags=b.
`<p> <h1> <div>`
Tags pertain to the generic elements of HTML.

=b IDs=b.
`#ticker #messagebox`
IDs apply to the specific element containing the matching ID.

=b Classes=b.
`.header .footer .attention`
Classes relate to elements with given classes.

=b Pseudo-Elements=b.
`:before :after :hover`
Pseudo elements are an adjunct to other elements that apply when those elements are in the given position/state.

/table

Combinations of elements can be used as follows:

	<b> <strong> #alertbox .attention

Rules will apply to all of the above elements.

	<b> in .jumbotron

Rules will apply to all `<b>` elements contained within elements of class `jumbotron`.

	<div> with .jumbotron

Rules will apply to all `div` elements with class `jumbotron`.

	<p> <q> with .attention

Rules will apply to all `<p>` and `<q>` elements with class `attention`.

	<pre> <code> with .rebol in #main

Rules will apply to all `<pre>` and `<code>` elements with class `rebol` contained within the element with the id `main`

Using `and` can separate rule combinations:

	<pre> with .rebol and <code> with .red

Rules will apply to all `<pre>` elements with class `rebol` **and** `<code>` elements with class `red`.

Any rules used before the first selector will apply to the `<body>` element.

--- Values

Values are an important component of each rule.
